                <h2>My Fun Fact</h2>
                <div>
                    Hola everyone, I am Tan Pei Yong. Just call me Pei Yong. I was born on 7 April and I am one of the three children. My hometown is Taiping, Perak. 
                    It's also known as rain town as it is the wettest town in Pennisular Malaysia. I am currently a computer science student in Universiti Sains Malaysia. 
                    Please don't ask me how is my uni life as I started my uni life by studying online at home. Hmm, so it is quite boring. 
                    I even didn't step into my uni, I don't how my uni looks like and I only can meet my coursemate virtually.
                 <br>

                    Tell you a secret, my height is 172 cm, so my friends like to call me bamboo. I started wearing glasees ever since I was four years old. Don't be shocked, hahaha. 
                    This is because I always spend my whole day to watch drama. I like light-colours like light-blue, mint-green and light-pink. Although I like mint-green, but I don't like to eat mint.
                    I love rainy day when I stay at home because I can view the scenary and have a cup of hot coffee.
